These are matrices defining the problems we showed in the paper.



setup_problem_matrix_more_#.m:

setup the cost function and increasing number of random quadratic constraints for the "increasing constraints" problems that compare our PCBA algorithm, Lasserre's BSOS, and MATLAB's fmincon.



setup_problem_matrix_P#.m:

setup the cost function and constraints for each of the 8 benchmark problems.



more_#.mat

For "increasing constraints", problems are generated and saved by helper_function/setup_problem_matrix_more.m. Results were showed in the paper based on these saved problems.
